# [forkphorus](https://forkphorus.github.io/)

A JavaScript compiler for Scratch projects. forkphorus is a *fork* of phos*phorus* that aims to be better in almost every way.

forkphorus tries to pick up where phosphorus left off by fixing many long standing issues and adding Scratch 3 project support. (early support is already available)
